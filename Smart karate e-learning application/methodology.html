          The proposed smart karate e-learning and performance analysis application
          is a mobile app aimed at enhancing skill development of karate practitioners.
          The application retrieves processed sensor data from the cloud
via a RESTful API, allowing users to access key performance
metrics such as body angles, movement accuracy, and
training progress.

          It also offers skill identification system utilizing
          deep learning techniques to assess a user’s proficiency level
          during their initial interaction with the platform.The deep learning model processes
          these features to classify the user’s skill level and enable
          personalized course recommendations.The certificate issuance and verification phase ensure the
          credibility of the e-learning platform. Upon successful course
          completion and skill evaluation, users receive a digitally
          verified certificate. This system provides a more secure
          certification verification QR system.The 3D modeling process involved creating detailed skeletal structures with control points to ensure
          authentic stance reproduction.

          The developed e-learning platform represents a significant
advancement in digital martial arts training and successfully
integrating technology with traditional karate instructions. By
leveraging innovative assessment methods, gamification and
immersive 3D learning modules.
