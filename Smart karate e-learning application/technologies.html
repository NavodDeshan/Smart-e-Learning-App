      <h1>Technologies Used</h1>

      <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>
            <strong>1. <em>Python</em></strong><br>
            <span class="description">Description: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used in data science, web development, automation, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing due to its extensive libraries and frameworks.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>2. <em>React</em></strong><br>
            <span class="description">Description: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. Created by Facebook, React allows developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state, making it highly efficient for building dynamic and responsive web applications. It follows a component-based architecture and uses a virtual DOM to improve performance.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>3. <em>IOT sensors</em></strong><br>
          <span class="description">Description: The ESP32 is a powerful, low-cost Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-enabled microcontroller widely used in IoT projects. It integrates dual-core processing, low-power modes, and versatile GPIO pins, making it ideal for smart devices, home automation, and wireless sensor networks. The MPU6050 is a popular 6-axis motion-tracking sensor combining a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope (with optional temperature readings). It enables precise detection of orientation, vibration, and movement, commonly used in drones, robotics, and wearable tech. Together, these sensors form a robust IoT solution for real-time data acquisition, wireless connectivity, and motion-based automation.

      </li>

        <li>
            <strong>4. <em>Firebase</em></strong><br>
            <span class="description">Description: Firebase is a comprehensive Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform developed by Google that provides a real-time NoSQL database (Firestore/Realtime Database), authentication, cloud storage, and other backend services. Its database solutions store data in JSON-like formats and offer seamless synchronization across clients in real-time, making it ideal for dynamic web and mobile applications. Firebase is designed for ease of use, scalability, and rapid development, enabling developers to focus on building responsive applications without managing server infrastructure. It is widely used for applications requiring real-time updates, user authentication, and serverless backend functionality.

              </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>5. <em>Blockchain</em></strong><br>
          <span class="description">Description: Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure, tamper-proof manner. Each "block" contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating an immutable chain. Blockchain enables trustless peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries. It underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, while also supporting applications in smart contracts, supply chain tracking, and digital identity. Key features include transparency, security, and resistance to fraud, making it transformative for finance, healthcare, and beyond.



          </span>
      </li>
        <li>
            <strong>6. <em>Expo Go</em></strong><br>
            <span class="description">Description: Expo Go is a mobile application developed by Expo that allows developers to instantly preview and test their React Native apps on iOS and Android devices without requiring native builds. It simplifies the development workflow by enabling live reloading, over-the-air updates, and easy debugging. Expo Go is ideal for rapid prototyping, collaborative development, and learning React Native, as it eliminates complex setup steps and provides a seamless way to run apps directly on physical devices or emulators.
              
              </span>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>7. <em>Google Colab</em></strong><br>
            <span class="description">Description: Google Colab (Colaboratory) is a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google. It supports Python and is widely used for data science, machine learning, and deep learning tasks. Colab allows users to write and execute Python code directly in the browser, with access to GPUs and TPUs for enhanced computational power.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>8. <em>Github</em></strong><br>
          <span class="description">Description: GitHub is a cloud-based platform for version control and collaborative software development, built on Git. It enables developers to host, review, and manage code repositories while facilitating teamwork through features like pull requests, issue tracking, and CI/CD integrations. GitHub supports open-source and private projects, offering tools for branching, merging, and deployment automation. Widely used by individuals and enterprises, it enhances productivity through seamless collaboration, code review workflows, and integrations with third-party development tools.
