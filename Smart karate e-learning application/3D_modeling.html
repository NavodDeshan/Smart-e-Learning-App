            Traditional Karate training emphasizes the importance of human interaction and the physical dojo environment. However, when translating this experience into an online format, it is difficult to replicate the sense of immersion and real-time feedback. By integrating 3D modeling and IoT technology, there is potential to create a virtual dojo environment that offers a more interactive and engaging learning experience.

          <li>
            This component focuses on creating a 3D modelling framework that enhances Karate e-learning platforms. By using high-fidelity 3D modelling technology, the system will provide anatomically accurate, kinematically precise visual representations of fundamental Karate techniques. Through 3D character rigging, multi-angle rendering, and motion capture data, learners will have the ability to analyse techniques from all perspectives, offering a deeper understanding of stances, strikes, blocks, and transitions. The integration of IoT-based performance monitoring will enable real-time data collection using wearable sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. This data will be compared against expert benchmarks to monitor the user’s performance and offer instant feedback on technique, posture, and alignment. By combining these technologies, the platform will provide an immersive learning experience where learners can analyse movements at different speeds, angles, and levels of complexity, creating a dynamic learning environment. The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between traditional dojo training and modern, technology-driven learning.

            The challenge here is designing 3D models that accurately represent Karate movements and ensure they are culturally and pedagogically appropriate. Additionally, integrating IoT devices like motion sensors and wearables with 3D models can provide real-time feedback on the learner’s performance. However, it is essential to ensure that these technologies are accessible, easy to use, and do not overwhelm the learner, as the goal is to enhance the traditional training experience, not replace it.

      <h1>Research Gap</h1>
      <ul class="custom-list">
        <!-- <li> -->
        <!-- </li> -->

        <li>
            1. Failure to Address Karate-Specific Needs:
            General sports-based e-learning tools are insufficient for the complex biomechanical and cultural demands of Karate. There is a clear gap in customizing tools to suit Karate's unique requirements.

        </li>

        <li>
            2. Minimal Combined Use of 3D and Sensors:
            Rarely are 3D models and sensors used in tandem in a unified platform for motion teaching and feedback. This reduces the potential for immersive, corrective learning experiences.

        </li>

        <li>
            3. Lack of Fine-Grained Motion Analysis:
            Platforms do not currently measure nuanced movement features like joint alignment, center of gravity shifts, or weight transfer, which are essential in Karate.

        </li>
        <li>
            4. Underexplored Impact on Different Skill Levels:
            There is insufficient research into how beginners vs. advanced practitioners interact with these technologies or benefit from them.

        </li>
        <li>
            5. Technology-Tradition Balance Not Studied:
            The philosophical dimensions of Karate training (e.g., spiritual focus, incremental mastery) are not adequately considered in the design or evaluation of tech-based learning tools.

        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <ul class="custom-list">

          <li>
            A custom 3D engine visualizes techniques using high-fidelity motion capture from expert practitioners.
            Users can explore models through a 360° viewer, zoom (50%–200%), and frame-by-frame playback,
            enabling deep analysis of biomechanical precision from any angle.
            </li>
<li>
    Key Visualization Features
    <ul>
        Anatomical Layer Breakdowns : Isolate muscle groups, joint angles, and skeletal alignments to
        analyze internal biomechanics not visible in standard videos.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Variable Speed Modulation: Adjust playback between 0.5x-2.0x for detailed technique
breakdown or rhythm training.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Comparative Performance Overlays: Overlay user recordings onto 3D expert models. Color-
coded indicators highlight execution errors for precise improvement
    </ul>
</li>
 <li>
    User performance metrics are systematically aggregated into a comprehensive centralized dashboard,

employing sophisticated machine learning (ML) algorithms to forecast individual learning trajectories with
increasing accuracy over time. A reinforcement learning model continuously adjusts course difficulty
parameters dynamically in response to performance patterns. For instance, if analytics reveal that a
particular user demonstrates mastery of advanced kicking techniques significantly faster than statistical
norms would predict, the system proactively introduces appropriate sparring scenarios earlier in their
progression to maintain optimal engagement and challenge levels
