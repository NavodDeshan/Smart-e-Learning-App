      <h1>Research Gap</h1>
      <p>
        1. Lack of Real-Time Multisensor Synchronization for Complex Movements
        While many existing studies employ single wearable sensors for activity recognition or skill classification, they often fail to synchronize multiple sensors (e.g., wrist, elbow, shoulder) in real-time. This limits the system's ability to accurately evaluate complex, full-body Karate movements, such as simultaneous blocking and counterattacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Limited Integration of Cognitive Assessment
Current systems focus heavily on physical metrics (speed, angle, accuracy), but do not integrate cognitive elements (like decision-making speed, technique selection, or theoretical knowledge) into real-time performance analysis. As a result, there is no unified approach to evaluating both physical execution and mental understanding of techniques.
      </p>

      <p>
       3. Insufficient Personalization Based on Demographic or Physiological Variability
Although some studies explore age and gender-based classification, most e-learning platforms do not adapt training content dynamically to a user’s physical conditions (e.g., injury risk, fatigue, BMI) or progression rate. This leads to one-size-fits-all recommendations that may not suit individual learners’ needs or capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        4. Limited Use of Blockchain for Verifiable, Scalable Certification
Few martial arts e-learning systems leverage blockchain for certificate issuance and validation. While the proposed system addresses this partially, there is limited exploration on scalability, interoperability, and privacy concerns related to decentralized verification methods in martial arts education.
      </p>

      <p>
        5. User Accessibility Challenges for Non-Technical Audiences
Most smart martial arts systems assume a moderate level of technological literacy. However, older or non-technical users face challenges in interacting with sensor-based systems, interpreting analytics dashboards, or engaging with 3D content. This highlights a lack of inclusive design and accessible user interfaces.
