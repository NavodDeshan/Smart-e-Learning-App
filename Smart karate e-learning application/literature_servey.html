      <h1>Literature Survey</h1>
      <ul class="custom-list">
        <!-- <li> -->
          In recent years, the convergence of wearable sensors, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various domains, including martial arts education. The literature suggests a growing trend in utilizing these technologies to create smart learning environments, specifically in  karate e-learning platforms.

1. Sensor-Based Performance Monitoring
The integration of inertial sensors (e.g., MPU6050) with microcontrollers like ESP32 has enabled precise capture of real-time biomechanical data such as angular velocity, acceleration, and joint angles. Studies like those by McGinnis and Sacripanti emphasized the use of such sensors for sports performance analysis and biomechanics in martial arts, highlighting their effectiveness in evaluating speed, accuracy, and body posture.
Chamomilla and Cook discussed how wearable technologies offer real-world, unrestricted movement tracking, which has become foundational in martial arts feedback systems. These sensors allow continuous and context-aware skill monitoring, critical for accurate performance assessment.

         2. AI-Based Skill Assessment
Ghasemzadeh and Pratama proposed machine learning and deep learning models for skill assessment using motion parameters. These approaches eliminate subjective bias found in traditional coaching and allow for objective classification of users into skill levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced) based on personalized attributes like age, gender, and motion efficiency.
Rehman further supported the feasibility of deep learning models to classify martial arts techniques, demonstrating promising results for real-time feedback systems.

        3. Real-Time Feedback and Data Analytics
Advanced data analytics have enhanced feedback mechanisms in martial arts. According to Chen, real-time motion capture systems offer immediate, actionable insights. Similarly, Madgwick emphasized orientation estimation using sensor fusion algorithms like complementary filters, which reduce drift and noise—an essential step in ensuring feedback reliability.
Studies by Li and Molina-Carmona also underline the value of adaptive and personalized feedback in digital education, supporting the smart karate system's goal of delivering individual learning experiences through analytics dashboards.

          4. 3D Visualization and Immersive Learning
Wang illustrated how 3D modeling enhances martial arts learning by providing multiple perspectives on movement execution. This aligns with the current study’s implementation of Blender-based character animation and WebGL for interactive 3D visualization, enabling users to explore stances and techniques with greater clarity.
Dandekar and Patil emphasized IoT-based human activity recognition, which, when combined with 3D animation, offers a superior alternative to conventional video tutorials.

            5. Learning Management and Certificate Verification
Modern e-learning platforms benefit from integrated Learning Management Systems (LMS) that support progress tracking, goal setting, and secure credentialing. Molina-Carmona and Arnedo [19] proposed adaptive learning strategies and QR-code-based certificate validation to prevent fraud. The current study expands on this by incorporating blockchain for immutable and verifiable certification, adding credibility and security to learners' achievements.
Nguyen and O’Connor noted that gamification and structured feedback in LMS significantly increase learner engagement and motivation—findings echoed by the current research, which uses badges, leaderboards, and progress visualizations.
