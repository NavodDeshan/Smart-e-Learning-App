            A primary challenge in Karate training is the effective assessment of skill levels and the customization of learning paths based on individual abilities. Traditional methods of skill evaluation often rely on subjective judgments, which can be inconsistent. A sensor-based approach, using accelerometers, gyroscopes, and other motion sensors, offers an objective method for real-time skill tracking. However, there remains a significant challenge in accurately interpreting this sensor data and translating it into meaningful skill assessments.

            This component of the research aims to develop an intelligent system for classifying Karate practitioners’ skill levels through real-time performance assessments. Using wearable sensors and alternative quiz-based assessments, the system will dynamically evaluate users based on critical parameters such as speed, adaptability, and task execution under random conditions. Unlike traditional methods that rely on predefined tasks, this system uses random task execution during registration to simulate unpredictable real-world scenarios, providing a more accurate reflection of a learner’s skill level. The primary focus will be on incorporating speed as the key metric for classification, as speed is a critical factor in many martial arts techniques. Additionally, the system will offer a dual evaluation approach by combining both sensor-based and quiz-based assessments to evaluate users’ physical skills and theoretical knowledge. This will result in a more comprehensive skill evaluation. The final goal is to provide personalized course recommendations based on the learner’s performance, and offer adaptive content that adjusts to the user’s evolving skill level, ensuring an optimal learning path. Furthermore, the system will include continuous skill monitoring with real-time feedback to help learners track their progress and receive actionable improvement tips.

 This component requires the development of a robust algorithm capable of processing sensor data to identify individual Karate techniques, such as punches, kicks, and stances, and assess their precision, speed, and overall execution. The system must then use this information to generate personalized course recommendations. The research challenge here is determining how to adapt existing machine learning models for movement recognition to ensure they can handle the specific requirements of Karate, such as the intricate fluidity and precision of the movements.

        <li>
            1. 	Lack of Real-Time Data Utilization
            Current e-learning platforms do not employ real-time data streams to adapt content or feedback to the learner's physical performance or skill level, particularly in domains like Karate where motion precision is critical.

        </li>

        <li>
         2. Static Content Delivery Models
         Most existing systems deliver pre-recorded, sequential content with no personalization or adjustment based on a learner’s progress, rate of learning, or performance quality.
        </li>

        <li>
        3. Absence of Intelligent Feedback Mechanisms
        There is limited research and implementation of systems capable of providing real-time, AI-driven feedback based on motion data, which can help learners improve during actual practice sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. Limited Skill level Monitoring and Adaptation
          The integration of dynamic, sensor-based skill tracking for continuous progress monitoring is missing, making it hard to provide learners with evolving content recommendations.

                Model architecture : 
                The skill classification system employs a hierarchical approach that integrates multiple machine learning models, each designed to handle specific aspects of the karate skill assessment process. The architecture consists of the following key components:
                <ul>• Technique Identification Model: Classifies the specific karate technique being performed</ul>
                <ul>• Technique-Specific Skill Models: Individual models for each technique that classify skill level   </ul>

                This two-stage approach acknowledges the distinct biomechanical characteristics and skill indicators associated with different karate movements.
